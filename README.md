<h1>Is a File Malicious</h1>
<h2>Final Project - Machine Learning Course - Tel Aviv University></h2>

We were provided with data containing various features of executable (.exe) files and tasked with building a model to predict whether a given file is likely to be malicious based on static analysis.
This project is a binary classification problem, where files were categorized into two classes: malicious (1) or non-malicious (0), depending on the features in the dataset.
The dataset included both known and anonymous features.

The data consisted of 60,000 labeled observations indicating whether each file was malicious or benign. Our approach involved analyzing and preprocessing the dataset, followed by selecting the most effective model to predict patterns in unseen test data.
